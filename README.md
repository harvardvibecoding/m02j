Continuing on from the prior unit, this project contains the resulting output of the instructor's AI when iteratively prompted for column mapping error fixes in `people_headcount_app.py`. The learner may optionally start from here to prompt for column mapping UI changes.

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run people_headcount_app.py
```
